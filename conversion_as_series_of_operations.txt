fahrenheit to celsius:
fahrenheit to kelvin -> kelvin to celsius

celsius to fahrenheit:
celsius to kelvin -> kelvin to fahrenheit

kelvin to fahrenheit:
kelvin to kelvin -> kelvin to fahrenheit

x to y:
x to kelvin -> kelvin to y
y to x:
y to kelvin -> kelvin to x


Let's standardize this as everything has to be stated from the point of view of
converting to kelvin.

x to y:
x to kelvin -> inverse of y to kelvin

y to x:
y to kelvin -> inverse of x to kelvin

celsius to kelvin: x + 273.15
inverse of celsius to kelvin is x - 273.15

fahrenheit to kelvin: (fahrenheit to celsius) as celsius to kelvin
= (fahrenheit to celsius) + 273.15
= (x - 32)*5/9 + 273.15


Therefore, we need a function that can invert its given function.
For example, we see here that fahrenheit to kelvin consists of three steps:
1. subtract 32, 2. Multiply by 5/9, and 3. Add 273.15

(x -32) * 5/9 + 273.15

We need to have a way where we can invert the operations to get kelvin to fahrenheit
1. subtract 273.15, 2. Multiply by 9/5, and 3. add 32

One way to do this is to introduce 'chain of operations', where for temperature, we have a chain of operations to get from given unit to kelvin. Then, to invert it, we do two things: Apply the chain in reverse, and revert whatever is being done in each part of the chain.
